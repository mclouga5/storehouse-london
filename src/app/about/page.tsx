            The Storehouse was founded in 2012 by Errol and Patsy Francis. With
            the help of our many volunteers, we provide food and clothing to our
            Hackney community every Sunday. Together, we collect donations from
            our generous sponsors then organise and distribute the donations to
            all that come through our doors; no questions asked.
            <br />
            <br />
            We continuously welcome new members to the team, who come as and when
            they can - for some people that means every week, for some maybe
            once a month. Either way, everyone&apos;s time is greatly appreciated, so
            if this sounds like something you&apos;d be interested in, please reach
            out! You can find our details on the contact page.

            As a charity, the Storehouse is always open to donations. Whether
            it&apos;s a small contribution, a fundraising effort, or some old clothes
            you were going to throw out, we and all those that come through
            our doors greatly appreciate it.
